News
======
We release [PAN](https://ifm.mbzuai.ac.ae/pan/), A World Model for General, Interactable, and Long-Horizon World Simulation!

Our Vision-G1 is accepted by AAAI 2026! See you in Singapore!

Our three papers are accepted by NeurIPS 2025, with one Spotlight! Thanks for my comrades!

Research Interests
======
Currently, my primary research lies in building Large-scale Multimodal Foundation Models. Concretely, I focus on training World Model and Multimodal Agent, improving their **Width (Universal Memory)** and **Depth (Reasoning and Planning Capabilities)**:

* **Unified Foundation Models**
  * ***Large-scale Training:*** [PAN: World Model](https://ifm.mbzuai.ac.ae/pan/), [YuLan-Chat: LLM](https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-Chat)
  * ***Reliable Evaluation:*** [Decentralized LLM-as-Judge](https://de-arena.maitrix.org/)
  * ***Review:*** [LLM Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18223) 7000 Citations!
* **Memory with Unified Representation to Read Anything**
  * ***General Memory for VLM:*** [CoMEM - NeurIPS 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17670)
  * ***Scalable Memory for Agent:*** [CoMEM-Agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09038?)
  * ***General Memory for World Model:*** [Coming soon!]
* **Stronger Reasoning and Planning Capability to Generate Anything?**
  * ***Scaling with Synthetic Data:*** [JiuZhang3.0 - NeurIPS 2024](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14365)
  * ***Scaling Data for RL:*** [Vision-G1 - AAAI 2026](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12680?)
  * ***Tool-Augmented Agent:*** [StructGPT - EMNLP 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09645), [DELI - NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02408), [KG-Agent - ACL 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11163)
